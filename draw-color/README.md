# draw-color
A Tensorflow implementation of [DRAW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623).

This is code to accompany [my post on the DRAW model](http://kvfrans.com/what-is-draw-deep-recurrent-attentive-writer/).

The original DRAW is a slightly rewritten, commented version of [Kevin implementation](https://github.com/jhui/machine_learning/tree/master/draw-color) and [ericjang's implementation](https://github.com/ericjang/draw), running on MNIST.

Usage:
```
python main.py
```

For color images:
Usage:
```
